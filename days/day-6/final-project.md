# The Dapp üöÄ
## Introduction
Congratulations! üèÜ You have verified all projects and got 100% on the [bootcamp dashboard](https://24ytc-bqaaa-aaaan-qdl7q-cai.ic0.app/). 
<br/>
You are now graduated and have become a real Web3 [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) developer! 
Now its possibly time to find a [job](https://airtable.com/shrwzsX9FhZ5X0wlv) within the IC community but you soon realize that you have more chance of finding a job if you made a real application with a **front-end** to navigate it.
You remember the great and fun time you had during the **Motoko Bootcamp** and would like to use one of the daily project challenges as a starting point.
As a newly **Motoko developer** the expertise and skills you aquired allow you to even add some extra features to it as a way of showcasing your talent!
## üßë‚Äçüè´ Requirements
_This project is free to do, and will not count towards your graduation!_

### Step 1: A choice
Choose one of the previous projects from this week.
[Calculator](../../day-1/project/README.MD)
[Homework Diary](../../day-2/project/README.MD)
[StudentWall](../../day-3/project/README.MD)
[MotoCoin](../../day-4/project/README.MD)
[The Verifier](../../day-5/project/README.MD)

### Step 2: Motoko
Add or modify features and try give the project a unique and creative twist. üé®
You are completely free to do as you please, but keep the project theme alive.

### Step 3: Front-End
1. Create a front-end structure with [create-ic](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/create-ic). 
(Tip: [MioQuispe](https://github.com/MioQuispe/create-ic-app) is a very useful ready-to-go framework setup for IC, supports Svelte/React/Vue) 
2. Allow users to login with atleast an Internet Identity account, you can also add more wallet support if you want.
3. Connect the back-end so people can interact with your Motoko code.
4. Add an [ICP banner](https://dfinity.frontify.com/d/XzkdhhDptijE/dfinity-brand-guide#/internet-computer/powered-by-crypto-badges) to showcase what great technology you have used. 
5. Make it pretty. (Tip: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) can allow for fast inline styling)

### Step 4: Deploy
You will deploy both a front-end and a back-end canister so that your Dapp is fully functional live on the IC network.
Share it with your fellow students, friends, family, or even the whole world if you want.
Use this as your first IC project to find work and continue your journey on becoming an expert Motoko developer!
<br/>
Publish your project publicly on Github and submit the repo link + front-end canister ID to [TODO: ADD URL or PERSON or FORM]  before [TODO: ADD DATE AND TIME]. 
We will pick out some of the best ones and showcase them during [TODO: ADD SCHEDULED EVENT LINK or DAY].
<br/>
Now take a break, you deserved it!
<br/>

[TODO: this line can be removed if you want] _This challenge has been kindly last minute setup by your fellow graduate Wannes_ üò∏ 

[TODO: MAKE FOLDER CALLED PROJECT AND CHANGE THIS FILENAME TO README.MD]
